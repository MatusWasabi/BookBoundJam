We will use this system as a way to carry your veggies around the farm house. 

## Sell point
When we are holding the veggies, and the veggies enter triggerbox, it will destroy that veggie in return of money

## Money
We gonna try using unreal engine subsytem as it is new concept to try but it can decouple the code
